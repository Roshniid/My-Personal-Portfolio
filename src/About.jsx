        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am {name}, really passionate to become a {profession}. I’m working towards gaining the full-stack knowledge and become a good software developer... do something that I love and can keep on doing willingly. I’m 23 years old, born and brought up in Kolkata, West Bengal. People who know me would describe me as resilient, dependable and resourceful. I always like to keep this learning mindset, increasing my knowledge horizon and wanting to make myself better each day. In my free time I indulge in my hobbies of reading fictional books, or writing some stuff of my own or extensively listening of music.</p>
